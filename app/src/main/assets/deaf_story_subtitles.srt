1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:04,037
[indistinct chatter, birds chirping,
car horn honking]

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:07,374
user: I really never thought
about how many sounds were around me...

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,043
until I started to lose my hearing.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,579
Stuff like cars and kids...

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,883
Dogs barking...
[dog barks]

6
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,385
Phones ringing...
[cell phones ringing]

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,722
I guess I kind of took it for granted
that I'd always hear them,

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,224
even if they were only background noise.

9
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,061
But at some point, the sounds
just kind of started to dissolve away.

10
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,564
[static hissing]

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,066
And then it just became, like, noise.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,235
For a while, that's all I heard--

13
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,570
just noise

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:40,073
without any specific sounds
that I could recognize.

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,745
Then one night I came across this movie,
and it had captions like...

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,080
"small dog is barking."

17
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,583
And I knew exactly what that sounded like.

18
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,252
Even though I couldn't actually hear
the barking,

19
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,755
I could remember it.
[dog barking]

20
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,090
That really made such a difference for me.

21
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,727
I felt like I could just sit back
and get lost in the movie.
