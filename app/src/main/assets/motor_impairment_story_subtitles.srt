00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,269
[school bell rings]

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,571
user: Let me tell you about something
that happened to me in high school.

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,439
[students chatting]

4
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,375
Like most kids,
I had a vibrant social life,

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,177
you know, I was doing well
with my grades,

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,080
and I was even a, you know, an athlete
on the basketball team,

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,815
so things were going well.
[whistle blowing]

8
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,383
And then one day--
[horn blares]

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,452
[crash]
I was in a car crash.

10
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,419
[sirens wailing]
[indistinct radio chatter]

11
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,488
I had to spend a long time
in the hospital.

12
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,290
[sirens wailing]
[indistinct radio chatter]

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,791
My friends would try
to make me feel better,

14
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,662
but they had their own lives going on
outside of the hospital.

15
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,565
Here I was, confined to my bed.
[hospital equipment beeping]

16
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,568
What I did to escape
was I used my phone.

17
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,871
I, you know, would read books
or watch movies

18
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,306
or, you know, play with different apps.

19
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,374
[lasers firing]

20
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,009
But it wasn't always easy to do.

21
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,411
I didn't have full use of my hands.

22
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,613
You know, my--
my wrists weren't in perfect shape,

23
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,182
so my hands shook a little bit.

24
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,116
[tapping]

25
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,752
So I had trouble tapping certain spots
on the phone.

26
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,454
[frustrated tapping]

27
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,758
Smaller and larger touch targets
may sound insignificant,

28
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,526
but their size truly made a difference

29
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,461
during the year that I spent
in the hospital.

30
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,666
