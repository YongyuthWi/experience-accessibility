user: No one thought I would get a PhD

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,906
because I couldn't read
until I was in high school.

[students chatting]

5
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,542
School was always tough for me

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,111
and I really struggled
to get through college.

7
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,747
But getting my PhD
was actually a breeze.

8
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,950
I know that sounds odd,
but I found this amazing counselor

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,120
who helped me figure out
that I had a learning disability.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,056
I learned methods to make reading
easier for me.

11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,025
For example, I highlighted text--

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,262
Which is still an option
while reading on my phone.

13
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,131
I appreciate it
when the writing is clear and concise

14
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,066
and broken up into small chunks.

15
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,801
It's easier for me to absorb.

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,005
My PhD is in English
so that I could teach others to write.

17

Learning to better articulate
your thoughts is beneficial

19
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,010
in all kinds of writing,

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,113
from essays to poems,
even technical writing.

21
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,248
If an idea is clearly expressed,

22
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,386
it's not simply easier to understand
for people with learning disabilities.

23
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,288
It's easier for everyone who reads it.

24
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,024
