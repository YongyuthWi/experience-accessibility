00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:05,205
user: The day I went blind
was the scariest day of my life.

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,374
Nothing would ever be the same.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,209
How would I do anything?

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:13,547
Reading, writing, even walking were things
I could no longer take for granted.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,882
[footsteps]

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,719
I remember as a kid, I used to be able to
see clear views around my neighborhood.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,887
[child shouts happily]

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,723
Over the years, things started to fade.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,726
Letters, words, signs,

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,562
even big ones became blurry
and hard to read...

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,730
[birds chirping]

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,398
Till one day it was all gone.

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,900
[animal howling]

14
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,568
I was so scared.

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,570
I was suddenly seeing nothing,

16
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,740
even with my eyes wide open.

17
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,408
But then I learned that my smartphone

18
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,745
had all these amazing accessibility
features, like screen readers.

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,247
As I played with my phone
and explored different apps,

20
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,417
I noticed that some
were easier to use than others.

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,086
For example, in some apps, I could hear...

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,923
phone:
Unlabeled button, unlabeled button.

23
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,257
user:
But in others...

24
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,759
phone:
Play video button.

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,027
Close button.

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,361
Create button.

27
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,697
user: And now I know
I've got a better experience

28
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,034
when the app has
accessibility labels for buttons.

29
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,704
The labels enable me
to use the phone on my own.

30
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,373
I'm now able to do lots of things
that I never thought would be possible

31
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,242
when I first lost my sight.
