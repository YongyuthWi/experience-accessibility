# Experience Accessibility

## Intro

Thank you for your interest in the Experience Accessibility app for Android! The
goal of the app is to let you experience accessibility from the perspective of
users with diverse accessibility needs (e.g. those who use screen readers or
benefit from captions, etc).

The app consists of:

-   4 immersive narratives/user stories that focus on:
    -   Blindness
    -   Deafness
    -   Motor impairment
    -   Learning disability followed by
-   Two versions of the same screen &mdash; one is more, and one less accessible to
    the user featured in the story. The focus is on:
    -   Accessibility labels
    -   Captions
    -   Touch target size
    -   Clear and concise instructions

## Suggested Audience

Please share this app with developers, designers and program/product managers --
anyone who may benefit from better understanding the importance of accessibility
in the products they create.

## Installation Instructions

```./gradlew installDebug```
